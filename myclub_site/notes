The WSGI File in Django
=======================
WSGI - Web Server Gateway Interface
Serves as the Interface between the server and our django application.

To host a django site, the server needs to be configured to host wsgi application.

HttpRequest and HttpResponse and Filename objects
=================================================
All these are found in the django.http modules.
A user always makes a request to the server and waits for a response.
The response is always made by the developer to determine what response is expected from the server.

request and response cycle
--------------------------
Hyper text transfer protocol + (s-secure)
Http is stateless...one request is totally dependent on its own.
A request does one of four things:
    -GET - retrieve data from the server
        -try your best not to make a get request with a form
    -POST - submit or send data to the server
        -contact form
        -creating a blog
        -creating a new profile on facebook
    -PUT - Update already existing data on the server
    -DELETE - Delete already existing data from the server

QueryDicts in python
====================
The items method in django works the same as that of python dictionaries. However it returns iterators instead of view object.
It returns the last value of the key if the key has multiple values.
